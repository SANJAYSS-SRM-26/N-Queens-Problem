# N-Queens-Problem
This C++ program solves the N-Queens problem using the backtracking algorithm. The N-Queens problem is a classic problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

## How to Use

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. The program will output a solution to the N-Queens problem for a given board size N.

## About the N-Queens Problem

In the N-Queens problem, the objective is to place N chess queens on an N×N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. 

## Implementation Details

The program utilizes a backtracking algorithm to recursively explore all possible placements of queens on the chessboard. It ensures that each placement is valid according to the rules of the N-Queens problem.

## Code Structure

The code consists of the following files:

- `NQueens.cpp`: Main C++ source code file containing the implementation of the N-Queens problem solver.
- `README.md`: This readme file providing instructions and information about the program.
